This is a BRC20 token Airdrop project on Bitcoin network. Bitmap ordinal owners can airdrop BRC20 tokens to taproot address. BmpBrc is a BRC20 airdrop platform in Bitcoin Network. I get user's taproot address and check user is bitmap ordinal owner or not. Integrate Unisat, Leader, XVerse wallets in Frontend and used PSBT, bitcoinjs lib for deploy, mint and send BRC20 tokens to user's taproot address. Get familiar with Ordinal technology(like utxo, psbt, inscribe), I can make the Bitcoin Defi project use Orinal or BRC20 tokens.

Everything is 100% secure, and it will be done through the BTC blockchain. Everything will be transparent. Borrowers won't have to send your ordinal anywhere during borrow money period. With the help of Deep Lake, DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts) and PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) for Ordinals.
