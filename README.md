I used Next for Frontend and Node for backend, MongoDB for Database. Also used Deep Lake API, DLC, Oracle and Corridor Finance API for liquidate and AMM. The alpha version will be published in testnet in soon. Now using Unisat Wallet only but in the future, users can use XVerse and Leader Wallet.

UnderWorld is a Ordinal Lending project on Bitcoin network. Users can borrow money use their Bitcoin Ordinals or swap their Ordinals to BTC. UnderWorldLending Platform is an BTC Lending Platform so users can borrow BTC use their BTC Ordinals or Swap Ordinals with BTC. The main purpose of this platform is to facilitate liquidity for borrowers who urgently need it or require it at a specific time. Additionally, we aim to help lenders earn money through this process. Everything is 100% secure, and it will be done through the BTC blockchain. Everything will be transparent. Borrowers won't have to send your ordinal anywhere during borrow money period. With the help of Deep Lake, DLCs (Discreet Log Contracts) and PSBT (Partially Signed Bitcoin Transactions) for Ordinals.

Bitmap is a BRC20 token Airdrop project on Bitcoin network. Ordinal owners can airdrop BRC20 tokens to taproot address. BmpBrc is a BRC20 airdrop platform in Bitcoin Network. I get user's taproot address and check user is bitmap ordinal owner or not. Integrate Unisat, Leader, XVerse wallets in Frontend and used PSBT, bitcoinjs lib for deploy, mint and send BRC20 tokens to user's taproot address. Get familiar with Ordinal technology(like utxo, psbt, inscribe), I can make the Bitcoin Defi project use Orinal or BRC20 tokens.
